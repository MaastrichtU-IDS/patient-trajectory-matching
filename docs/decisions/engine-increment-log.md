# Engine increment: decision log

From 2026-11-06 the project lead delegated three workstreams and every decision in them:

1. package the engine in place;
2. build an execution store (a columnar store, Postgres with embeddings, and/or a Rust engine were allowed);
3. build a SULO adapter for the trajectory-graph engine.

This log records each decision, the alternatives and the reasoning, in the order they were taken. An independent design review by a separate model ("the advisor") preceded the decisions, and its points are credited where adopted or declined. Each entry names the pull request that implements it.

## D1 Package with hatchling, in place

A `pyproject.toml` builds a wheel containing `patterns/` (without `test_*`, `verify_*` and caches), `reference_oracle.py` as a top-level module, the lock files, and the contracts the engine reads at run time (`schemas/*.json`, `ontology/*.ttl`, `ontology/vendor/`, `ontology/sulo-pin.json`, `ontology/toy-taxonomy.json`) as package data under `patterns/_contracts/`. Optional dependencies are extras: `semantic` (rustdl) and `store` (DuckDB). Nothing is published, and there are no console scripts. The import name `patterns` is generic and could collide in a shared environment, so renaming waits for stage 3 (design §10.4).

*Alternatives:* setuptools, which offers nothing extra here; moving the code under `src/`, which would break every report binding by path; publishing, which is premature.

## D2 One locator, behind the existing `ROOT`

Nearly every engine module builds paths from `pro_solid.ROOT`, re-exported as `exact_intervals.ROOT`. A new `patterns/_resources.py` supplies it:
- **In a checkout** it is the same `Path` as today.
- **Installed**, it is a small path-like object. It serves `patterns/…` from the package, `schemas/…` and `ontology/…` from `_contracts`, and raises `REPOSITORY_RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE:<path>` for anything else. Examples, data pins and reports are repository resources, so nothing is ever written into site-packages.

The only existing line changed is the `ROOT` definition in `pro_solid.py`.

*Alternative declined:* design §10.4 proposed replacing the direct reads (`ROOT / 'schemas/…'`) module by module. That is more than 80 reads in about 60 modules, and would invalidate about 30 reports, three of them reproducible only on Linux. The advisor argued against it, and I agree: one definition, one blast radius.

## D3 Regenerate what the locator change invalidates; cut a v26 manifest

Changing `pro_solid.py` invalidates the reports that bind it. They are regenerated in the same pull request:
- the completion register;
- the MIMIC record-query demo report, from the verified demo files (D11);
- the research-prototype journey and its run copy;
- the test-count report.

The v25 release manifest describes a past release, so it is not rewritten. A v26 manifest is cut, and v25 joins the historical exemptions in `tools/check_report_provenance.py` and `.github/scripts/check_manifest.py`, as v24 already is.

**Amended after review (#120).**
- **v26 scope.** The v26 manifest binds the same nine files as v25, with current digests, not the packaging files. Binding packaging files would break every later branch's manifest check.
- **A digest the provenance gate can't see.** The guided cohort records the `pro_solid.py` digest in `projection_sha256`, which a demo test checks but the gate does not. So the guided cohort and the patient-similarity fixture that pins it were rebuilt too.
- **The installed-package check proves equality:**
  - it derives the expected module list from the checkout, so new modules don't break it;
  - it requires the two probes to import from site-packages and from the checkout respectively;
  - it compares every wheel file byte for byte with its source.
- **Checkout detection** requires named contract files.
- **A dedicated error.** Refusals raise `RepositoryResourceUnavailable`, a `LookupError`, so command-line handlers that catch `ValueError` do not relabel them as bad input.
- **`temporal_interface`** now imports when installed.
- **Python version.** Python 3.12 is required, since that is what CI tests.
- **The `store` extra** is left to the store pull request.

## D4 Execution store on embedded DuckDB with immutable Parquet snapshots

The store is DuckDB, embedded and pinned in its own lock behind the `store` extra and imported lazily, writing immutable Parquet snapshots partitioned by patient bucket.
- There is no service to run, so CI needs only pip.
- It is columnar and handles full MIMIC-IV (about 330 million chart rows) on one machine.
- Parquet moves to BigQuery, ClickHouse or a Rust/DataFusion worker without a format migration.

The repository already pairs an indexed store with an independent reference (`indexed_source_windows` over SQLite), and the store follows that pattern: a pure-Python reference builds the same tables, and tests compare them row for row.

*Alternatives:*
- SQLite: standard library, but it would need replacing before full MIMIC.
- Postgres with pgvector: a server with no benefit in this increment, and design §6 defers embeddings.
- A Rust engine first: the matcher's semantics are still moving, and a port needs its own differential harness.

## D5 Store schema, time origin and snapshot identity

**Tables:**
- `patients`: dense index, identifier, bucket.
- `events`: patient, event, kind, clock, start and end bounds, ongoing, status, selection state, recorded and available times, claim identifier and digest, source table, record and file digest.
- `event_concepts`, with a basis for each concept.
- `concept_closure`, with basis and version.
- `concept_postings`: concept, patient, count, earliest and latest start.
- `coverage`: patient, source, clock, bounds, basis.

**Time origin.** Times are integer microseconds on the patient-local calendar from the fixed origin 0001-01-01, as `indexed_source_windows` uses, so a time never depends on the request that produced it.

**Snapshot identity.** The snapshot identifier is the digest of the canonical inputs plus each table's row count and canonical-content digest. It is computed over sorted canonical rows, never Parquet bytes, which vary with the writer.

## D6 First store increment indexes source item classes, not clinical concepts

The MIMIC-IV demo's claims are imported pending, and its items map only to their source item code classes; clinical mappings wait on a qualified reviewer (D-CLINICAL). So the first store indexes recorded source records under source item classes, and says so in its labels and reports. The concept hierarchy, information content and relaxation logic are tested on the synthetic paediatric cohort, which has a real hierarchy.

**Data.** `inputevents`, `icustays` and `d_items` (100 patients, 140 stays, 20,404 rows). `chartevents` (668,862 rows) waits for a later increment.

**Candidate filter.** For each step, the union of postings for its concept and for every concept widening within the relaxation budget, intersected across steps with the rarest first. This is sound under relaxation. Time-based pruning on the posting summaries waits until differential tests cover it.

**Comparability.** A patient whose window a source does not cover is reported as not comparable, never as no match.

## D7 No embeddings, Postgres or Rust in the first store increment

Information content per snapshot comes from posting counts, the baseline of design §5 and §6. An approximate-nearest-neighbour index is added only if recall at full scale needs it. Postgres is kept for jobs, results and audit (FR-060, FR-061, FR-081). A Rust engine would come later, as a second implementation over the same Parquet files, with the Python path as its reference.

## D8 The adapter reads `bounded_intervals.Snapshot`; the graph route is canonical

Bounded JSON, bounded RDF, patient-local graphs and claim selections all reach `bounded_intervals.Snapshot`, so `patterns/trajectory_graph_sulo.py` reads that, and the graph route is the canonical one ("the graph wins"). The point-anchor oracle is a fixed three-step pattern, and exact-interval graphs are the bounded case with equal bounds, so neither needs its own route.

Engine event identifiers are snapshot event identifiers, and each bound step's evidence (evidence identifier, claim, role, person, source record and hash, context) is carried into the result. Concepts are IRIs. Ancestors come from the loaded ontology, computed once per run, and each event–concept pair records its basis. An unknown query or relaxation concept is refused rather than matched as nothing. Modules bound by Linux-only reports (`claim_projection`, `temporal_stn`, `mimic_*`) are not edited.

## D9 Adapter time, clocks and refusals

Each patient's variables are tightened to their minimal bounds from the snapshot's network.
- **Constraints a box can't represent.** If a patient's source constraints go beyond bounds and proper intervals, the adapter refuses (`SOURCE_CONSTRAINTS_NOT_BOX_REPRESENTABLE`). Exactness over the box would be sound, but possibility would not.
- **Witness checks.** Every possible witness is checked against the source network plus the query's edges.
- **Clocks.** There is one clock per patient. Clocks with offset-datetime origins are rebased by their exact integer difference; otherwise the events are left out and the patient is reported incomparable.
- **Units.** Declared units convert to microseconds exactly, and calendar months are refused (T3, T4).
- **Window.** The index window is explicit in the request.

## D10 Sequencing, ownership and merge order

- Packaging and the adapter run in parallel worktrees; the adapter only adds files.
- The store starts on the synthetic fixture, and MIMIC ingest waits for the adapter's row.
- Each workstream owns its own workflow file.
- Shared generated reports (completion register, test counts) are regenerated after each rebase.
- Packaging merges first, because it cuts the v26 manifest.
- Straightforward implementation goes to a smaller model, and design-heavy work to a larger one. A separate reviewer reads each non-trivial pull request before it merges.

## D11 MIMIC-IV demo files are fetched locally and verified, never committed

The open-access MIMIC-IV demo 2.2 files are downloaded from PhysioNet into the git-ignored `data/local-mimic/`, and each is verified against the published `SHA256SUMS.txt`: inputevents, icustays, d_items, chartevents, patients, admissions. Only aggregate reports are committed, as before. CI does not download patient data.

## D12 Merges wait for a settled, complete, green check run

On 2026-11-06 a watcher merged #116 while one check was still pending, because GitHub had not yet registered it after a push. The check later passed. Since then a pull request merges only when at least the expected number of checks are registered, none are pending, every one passed, and that holds on two polls a minute apart.
